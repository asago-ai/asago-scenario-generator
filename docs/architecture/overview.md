# Architecture overview

Asago Scenario Generator has one shared domain and two supported generation
workflows.

## Shared domain

Pydantic models define capability profiles, taxonomy evidence, projected
attack chains, attack trees, behavior specifications, scenario envelopes, and
run manifests. Shared LLM adapters, deterministic validators, evaluation, and
reporting sit around those contracts.

## Taxonomy and risk-driven workflow

The `generate` workflow consumes a use-case description, policy risk
extraction, and SSSOM mappings. It derives a capability profile and threat
surface, expands and qualifies candidates, projects canonical chains, creates
scenario artifacts, and runs deterministic admission and evaluation gates.

## STPA workflow

The `stpa-run` workflow performs loss and hazard analysis, constructs the
control structure, enumerates unsafe control actions and threats, and produces
scenario, evaluation, and reporting artifacts. Its stages reuse shared
capability and infrastructure contracts while retaining STPA-specific models
and orchestration.

## Acceptance boundary

`features/` contains the behavior contract. `acceptance/refresh_snapshot.py`
uses the externally checked-out Acceptance Pipeline Specification tools to
create ignored JSON IR, DRY reports, and pytest entrypoints under
`build/acceptance/`. The committed runtime and handlers connect those generated
entrypoints to public project behavior.

Live LLM behavior is a separate opt-in boundary. Default unit and acceptance
gates must remain deterministic and offline.

## Persistence boundary

Generated product output is not source. Taxonomy/risk runs use immutable,
manifest-governed run directories. STPA runs persist stage artifacts and a
combined manifest/report in their requested output directory. Pre-rename output
is retained only in the archived source repository and is not accepted as a
compatibility contract.
